Reinforcement Learning Resources
================================


Stable-Baselines assumes that you already understand the basic concepts of Reinforcement Learning (RL).

However, if you want to learn about RL, there are several good resources to get started:

- `OpenAI Spinning Up <https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/>`_
- `David Silver's course <http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html>`_
- `More resources <https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning>`_
